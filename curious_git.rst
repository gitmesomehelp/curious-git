*****************
git - love - hate
*****************

I've used git now for a long time.  I think it is a masterpiece of design, I
use it all day every day and I just can't imagine what it would be like not to
use it. So, no question, I *love* git.

As y'all may know, `Linus Torvalds wrote git from scratch
<http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git>`_.  He
loves it too.  `Here is Linus talking about git
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShbP3OpASA#t=2288>`_ in a question and answer
session:

    Actually I'm proud of git. I want to say this. The fact that I had to
    write git was accidental, but Linux, the design came from a great mind,
    and that great mind was not mine. I mean you have to give credit for the
    design of Linux to Kernighan and Ritchie and Thompson. I mean there's a
    reason I like Unix and I wanted to redo it. I do want to say that git is a
    design that is mine and unique, and I'm proud of the fact that I can damn
    well also do good design from scratch.

But - some people hate git.  Really *hate* it. They find it confusing and
error prone and it makes them angry.  Why are there such different views?

I think the reason some people hate git, is because they don't yet understand
it.  I reason I can say this without being patronizing is because I went
through something similar myself.

When I first started using git, I found it uncomfortable.  I could see it was
very powerful, but I sometimes got lost and stuck and had to Google for a set
of magic commands to get me out of trouble.  I once accidentally made a huge
mess of our project's main repository by running a command I didn't
understand. Git often made me feel stupid.  It felt like a prototype racecar
with a badly designed dashboard that was just about to blow a tire or an
engine and take me off the road.

Then, one day, I read the `git parable`_.  The git parable is a little story
about a developer trying to work out how to make a version control system.  It
gradually builds up from copying whole directories of files to something very
much like git.  I didn't understand it all right away, but as soon as I read
that page, the light-bulb went on - I got git.  I suddenly started to feel
comfortable.  I knew for sure I could work out why git worked the way it did.
I could see that it must be possible to do complicated and powerful
things, and I could work out how to do them.

Reading the git parable took me about 45 minutes, but those 45 minutes changed
me from an unhappy git user to someone who
uses git often every day, but, happily, knowing that I have the right tool for
the job.

So, my experience tells me that to use git - yes *use* git - you need to spend
that 45 minutes to *understand* git.  You don't believe me, or you think that
I'm a strange kind of person not like you who probably likes writing their own
operating systems. Not so - the insight I'm describing comes up over and over.
From `understanding git conceptually
<http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git>`_:

    When I first started using Git, I read plenty of tutorials, as well as the
    user manual. Though I picked up the basic usage patterns and commands, I
    never felt like I grasped what was going on “under the hood,” so to speak.
    Frequently this resulted in cryptic error messages, caused by my random
    guessing at the right command to use at a given time. These difficulties
    worsened as I began to need more advanced (and less well documented)
    features.

Here's a quote from the `pro git book <http://git-scm.com/book>`_ by Scott
Chacon.  The git book is a standard reference that is hosted on the main git
website.

    Chapter 9: Git Internals

    You may have skipped to this chapter from a previous chapter, or you may
    have gotten here after reading the rest of the book — in either case, this
    is where you’ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. I
    found that learning this information was fundamentally important to
    understanding how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to me
    that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus,
    I’ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read
    it early or later in your learning process. I leave it up to you to
    decide.

.. comment yoh -- below you demand an hour while above only 45
           minutes.  Do not raise stakes! ;-)

So - have no truck with people who try and tell you that you can just use git
and that you don't need the `deep shit
<http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide>`_.  You *do* need the deep shit, but
the deep shit isn't that deep, and it will take you an hour of your time to get
it.  And then I'm betting that you'll see that the alchemist has succeeded at
last, and the shit finally turned into gold.

So - please - invest an hour of your life to understand this stuff.
Concentrate, go slowly, make sure you get it. In return for an hour of your
life, you will get many happy years for which git will appear in its true
form, both beautiful and useful.

The one thing about git you really need to understand
=====================================================

git is not really a "Version Control System". It is better described
as a "Content Management System", that turns out to be really good for
version control.

I'll say that again.  Git is a content management system.  Or - to quote from
the `root page of the git manual <http://git-scm.com/docs/git.html>`_: "git -
the stupid content tracker".

****************
A familiar story
****************

To understand why git does what it does, we first need to think about what a
content manager should do, and why we would want one.

As in the `git parable`_ - we'll try and design our own, and then see what
git has to say.

(To go through this a little more slowly, and with more jokes, you might also
try my  `git foundations
<http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/foundation.html>`__ page).

While we are designing our own content management system, we will do a lot of
stuff longhand, to show how things work.  When we get to git, we will find it
does these tasks for us.

The story so far...
===================

You are writing a breakthrough paper showing that you can entirely
explain the brain using random numbers. You've got the draft paper, and
the analysis script and a figure for the paper. These are all in a
directory modestly named ``nobel_prize``.

In this directory, you have the paper draft ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``, the
analysis script ``very_clever_analysis.py``, and a figure for the paper
``stunning_figure.png``.

You can get this ground-breaking paper by downloading and unzipping
:download:`nobel_prize_files.zip`.

.. runblock::
    :hide:

    # clean up old files from previous doc run
    rm -rf nobel_prize my_repos fake_home/.gitconfig

.. desktoprun:: bash

    unzip -o nobel_prize_files.zip

Here's what we get in our ``nobel_prize`` directory:

.. desktoprun::

    ls nobel_prize

The dog ate my results
======================

You've been working on this paper for a while.

About 2 weeks ago, you were very excited with the results. You ran the script,
made the figure, and went to your advisor, Josephine. She was excited too. The
figure looks good! You get ready to publish in Science.

Today you finished cleaning up for the Science paper, and reran the analysis,
and it doesn't look that good anymore. You go to see Josephine. She says "It
used to look better than that". That's what you think too. But:

* **Did it really look better before?**
* If it did, **why does it look different now?**

Deja vu all over again
======================

Given you are so clever and you have worked out the brain, it's really
easy for you to leap in your time machine, and go back two weeks to
start again.

What are you going to do differently this time?

Make regular snapshots
======================

You decide to make your own content management system called
``fancy_backups``.

It's very simple.

Every time you finish doing some work on your paper, you make a snapshot
of the analysis directory.

The snapshot is just a copy of all the files in the directory, kept
somewhere safe.

You make a directory to store the snapshots called ``.fancy_backups``:

.. desktoprun:: bash

    cd nobel_prize

.. prizerun::

    mkdir .fancy_backups

Then you make a directory for the first backup:

.. prizerun::

    mkdir .fancy_backups/1
    mkdir .fancy_backups/1/files

And you copy the files there:

.. prizerun::

    cp * .fancy_backups/1/files

Reminding yourself of what you did
==================================

For good measure, you put a file in the snapshot directory to remind you when
you did the snapshot, and who did it, and what was new for this snapshot. Call
this file ``info.txt``.  So, we write something like this:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/1/info.txt
    Date: April 1 2012, 14.30
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: First backup of my amazing idea

Now you have these files in the ``nobel_prize`` directory:

.. prizerun::

    tree -a

Every time you do some work on the files, you back them up in the same
way. After a few days:

.. prizerun::

    # Append some text to nobel_prize_paper.txt
    echo "The charts are very impressive" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    # Make a new snapshot
    mkdir .fancy_backups/2
    mkdir .fancy_backups/2/files
    cp * .fancy_backups/2/files

We make a new ``info.txt`` file describing what is new in this snapshot:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/2/info.txt
    Date: April 1 2012, 18.03
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Fruit of enormous thought

The next day we write a little more on our paper:

.. prizerun::

    # Append some more text to nobel_prize_paper.txt
    echo "The graphs are also compelling" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    # Make another shapshot
    mkdir .fancy_backups/3
    mkdir .fancy_backups/3/files
    cp * .fancy_backups/3/files

We add a description of these changes:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/3/info.txt
    Date: April 2 2012, 11.20
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Now seeing things clearly

After three days of work we have three snapshots in our backup directory:

.. prizerun::

    tree -a

You keep doing this for another couple of days, until again the time comes to
talk to Josephine. By now you have 5 snapshots.

.. prizerun::
    :hide:

    # Now we just cheat, and copy the commits
    cp -r .fancy_backups/3 .fancy_backups/4
    cp -r .fancy_backups/3 .fancy_backups/5

The future has not changed. Josephine again thinks the results have
changed. But now - you can check.

You go back and look at ``.fancy_backups/1/stunning_figure.png``. It
does look different.

You go through all the ``.fancy_backups`` directories in order. It turns
out that the figure changes in ``.fancy_backups/4``.

You look in ``.fancy_backups/4/info.txt`` and it says::

    Date: April 4 2012, 01.40
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: I always get the best ideas after I have been drinking.

Aha. Then you go find the problem in ``very_clever_analysis.py`` very
quickly since instead of eyeballing the entire script you need to
inspect only the difference between
``fancy_backups/3/very_clever_analysis.py`` and
``fancy_backups/4/very_clever_analysis.py`` to find the not so
ingenious *optimization* you have introduced.

You fix ``very_clever_analysis.py``.

You make a new snapshot ``.fancy_backups/6``.

.. prizerun::
    :hide:

    # Cheat again
    cp -r .fancy_backups/3 .fancy_backups/6

Back on track for a scientific breakthrough.

Terminology breakout
====================

Here are some
`terms <https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html>`__.

Working tree
    The files you are working on in the current directory (``nobel_prize``).
    The files ``very_clever_analysis.py``, ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``,
    ``stunning_figure.png`` are the files in your working tree.

Repository
    The directory containing information about the history of the files. Your
    directory ``.fancy_snapshot`` is the repository.

Commit
    A completed snapshot. For example, ``.fancy_backups/1`` contains one
    commit.

We'll use these terms to get used to them.

Breaking up work into chunks
============================

You did some edits to the paper ``nobel_prize_paper.txt`` to edit the
introduction.

You also had a good idea for the analysis, and did some edits to
``very_clever_analysis.py``.

You've got used to breaking each new *commit* (snapshot) up into little
bits of extra work, with their own comments in the ``info.txt``.

You want to make two commits from your changes:

1. a commit containing the changes to ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``, with comment
   "Changes to introduction";
2. Another commit containing the changes to ``very_clever_analysis.py``
   with comment "Crazy new analysis"

How can I do that?

The staging area
================

You adapt the workflow. Each time you have done a commit, you copy the contents of
the commit to directory ``.fancy_backups/staging_area``. That will be the
default contents to be considered for your next commit.

.. prizerun::

    mkdir .fancy_backups/staging_area
    cp .fancy_backups/6/files/* .fancy_backups/staging_area
    ls .fancy_backups/staging_area

Now, you do your edits to ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``, and
``very_clever_analysis.py`` in your *working tree* (the ``nobel_prize``
directory). You want to make a new commit containing the changes to the paper
but not the changes to the script.  You get ready for the next commit with:

.. prizerun::

    cp nobel_prize_paper.txt .fancy_backups/staging_area

The staging area now contains all the files for the upcoming commit
(snapshot). The upcoming commit only has the changes in the paper.

You make the commit by making the usual directories, and copying the contents
of the staging area into the commit ``files`` directory:

.. prizerun::

    # Make commit directories
    mkdir .fancy_backups/7
    mkdir .fancy_backups/7/files
    # Copy contents of staging area into commit directory
    cp .fancy_backups/staging_area/* .fancy_backups/7/files

with message:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/7/info.txt
    Date: April 10 2012, 14.30
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Changes to introduction

After we have done the commit this way, by coping the staging area to the
commit ``files`` directory, the staging area is identical to the contents of
the commit.  Now you are ready for the next commit, that adds the changes to
the analysis script.

.. prizerun::

    cp very_clever_analysis.py .fancy_backups/staging_area

The commit is now *staged* and ready to be saved.

.. prizerun::

    # Our commit procedure; same as last time with "8" instead of "7"
    mkdir .fancy_backups/8
    mkdir .fancy_backups/8/files
    cp .fancy_backups/staging_area/* .fancy_backups/8/files

The message is:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/8/info.txt
    Date: April 10 2012, 14.35
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Crazy new analysis

Here is what you have in your ``.fancy_backups`` directory:

.. prizerun::

    tree -a .fancy_backups

Now the very difficult problem
==============================

Let's say that the figure ``stunning_figure.png`` is large.

Let's say it changes only once across our 8 commits, at commit 5, but
we keep copying it again and again to new commits.

What should we do to save disk space for ``.fancy_backups``?

Cryptographic hashes
====================

This section describes "Crytographic hashes". These are the key to an
excellent way to store our snapshots.  Later we will see that they are central
to the way that git works.

See : `Wikipedia on hash
functions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function>`__.

A *hash* is the result of running a *hash function* over a block of
data. The hash is a fixed length string that is the *signature* of that
exact block of data.  One common hash function is called SHA1.  Let's run this
via the command line:

.. desktoprun::

    # Make a file with a single line of text
    echo "git is a rude word in UK English" > git_is_rude
    # Show the SHA1 hash
    shasum git_is_rude

Not too exciting so far. However, the rather magical nature of this string is
not yet apparent. This SHA1 hash is a *cryptographic* hash because

* the hash value is (almost) unique to this exact file contents, and
* it is (almost) impossible to find some other file contents with the same
  hash

In other words, there is no practical way for you to find another file with
different contents that will give the same hash.

For example, a tiny change in the string makes the hash completely different.
Here I've just added a full stop at the end:

.. desktoprun::

    echo "git is a rude word in UK English." > git_is_rude_stop
    shasum git_is_rude_stop

So, if you give me some data, and I calculate the SHA1 hash value, and it
comes out as ``30ad6c360a692c1fe66335bb00d00e0528346be5``, then I can be very
sure that the data you gave me was exactly the ASCII string "git is a rude
word in UK English".

A crazy idea - use hash values as file names
============================================

Make a new directory:

.. prizerun::

    mkdir .fancy_backups/objects

Calculate the hash value for the figure:

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/1/files/stunning_figure.png

Save the figure with the hash value as the file name:

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/1/files/stunning_figure.png .fancy_backups/objects/aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864

Do the same for the other two files in the first commit.

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/1/files/nobel_prize_paper.txt
    shasum .fancy_backups/1/files/very_clever_analysis.py

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/1/files/nobel_prize_paper.txt .fancy_backups/objects/3af8809ecb9c6dec33fc7e5ad330e384663f5a0d
    cp .fancy_backups/1/files/very_clever_analysis.py .fancy_backups/objects/e7f3ca9157fd7088b6a927a618e18d4bc4712fb6

We now have three new files in ``.fancy_backups/objects``, one corresponding
to each unique file *contents* we have hashed:

.. prizerun::

    tree -a .fancy_backups/objects

Making the directory listing
============================

The snapshot has three files.  We can think of the file has having *content*
(the bytes contained in the file) and a *filename*.  We have already stored
the contents in the object directory, but with a different filename, from the
hash of the contents.  To record the filenames, we need to make a directory
listing.

To do this, we can point the snapshot to the hash filename versions of the
files by making a *text directory listing* or *tree* listing:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/1/directory_list
    Filename                Hash value
    ========                ==========
    nobel_prize_paper.txt   3af8809ecb9c6dec33fc7e5ad330e384663f5a0d
    stunning_figure.png     aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864
    very_clever_analysis.py e7f3ca9157fd7088b6a927a618e18d4bc4712fb6

The next commit - saves space!
==============================

Now we work on the files from the second commit. These are the files in
``.fancy_backups/2/files``.

Remember that we only changed ``nobel_prize_paper.txt`` in this commit.

Do we need to copy ``nobel_prize_papar.txt`` or ``stunning_figure.png`` to the
objects directory again?

No - because they have not changed.  Because they have not changed, their hash
values have not changed.  Because their hash values have not changed, and
because the hash values are unique to the contents, we already have the files
we need in the ``objects`` directory.

Specifically, because ``.fancy_backups/2/stunning_figure.png`` is the same as
``.fancy_backups/1/stunning_figure.png`` we know that the hash is the same,
and the hash is the one we've already calculated,
``aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864``.  We already have a file
``.fancy_backups/objects/aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864``, and we
know, because the hash values are unique, that this file must contain the
exact contents of ``.fancy_backups/1/stunning_figure.png``, which is also the
exact contents of ``.fancy_backups/2/stunning_figure.png``.

So in general, if we do a hash on a file, and then we find a filename the same
as this hash in the objects directory, we already have that exact contents
backed up, and we don't need to do a copy.

Here are the hashes for the files in commit 2:

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/2/files/nobel_prize_paper.txt
    shasum .fancy_backups/2/files/stunning_figure.png
    shasum .fancy_backups/2/files/very_clever_analysis.py

We already have files ``aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864`` and
``e7f3ca9157fd7088b6a927a618e18d4bc4712fb6`` in ``.fancy_backups/objects``, so
the only file we need to copy is ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``:

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/2/files/nobel_prize_paper.txt .fancy_backups/objects/90aa1015732676bf63d2d950714a1f11196875fc

Here then is our directory listing for commit 2:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/2/directory_list
    Filename                Hash value
    ========                ==========
    nobel_prize_paper.txt   90aa1015732676bf63d2d950714a1f11196875fc
    stunning_figure.png     aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864
    very_clever_analysis.py e7f3ca9157fd7088b6a927a618e18d4bc4712fb6

An even more crazy idea - hash the directory list
=================================================

The directory listing is just a text file.  We can store the directory listing
as we store the other files, by writing an object file with the file hash:

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/1/directory_list

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/1/directory_list .fancy_backups/objects/b7c9cd682e7d4bf28b82e76fb2276608f49e16d5

And we can do the same for the second commit:

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/2/directory_list

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/2/directory_list .fancy_backups/objects/4f379c649a596d2f9cc2cf5b91f4a67a3101b65e

Now - would I get the same hash for the directory listing if I had had a
different figure?

Even more crazy idea - make the whole commit into a text file
=============================================================

We've seen that we can make a directory listing that is unique for the whole
contents of the snapshot files (file contents and file names).  Therefore the
*hash* of the directory listing is also unique for the contents of the
snapshot files.  So, we can make a *commit file* that is the ``info.txt`` file
above, but now with the hash of the directory listing included.  Including the
directory listing means that this *commit file* is now also unique to the
contents of the snapshot.  The commit file for the first commit might look
something like this:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/1/commit
    Date: April 1 2012, 14.30
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: First backup of my amazing idea
    Tree: b7c9cd682e7d4bf28b82e76fb2276608f49e16d5

The commit file for the second commit might look like this:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/2/commit
    Date: April 1 2012, 18.03
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Fruit of enormous thought
    Tree: 4f379c649a596d2f9cc2cf5b91f4a67a3101b65e

The commit is now just a text file, and I can hash this too:

.. prizerun::

    shasum .fancy_backups/1/commit
    shasum .fancy_backups/2/commit

.. prizerun::

    cp .fancy_backups/1/commit .fancy_backups/objects/012ad9f6c3a715516514e8821a71d891c4211f8f
    cp .fancy_backups/2/commit .fancy_backups/objects/d4c297c8b0c768647e0b3faa9308a40d0e3cb4ba

Would the commit hash value change if the figure changed?

So crazy it's actually git
==========================

Now look in ``.fancy_backups/objects``:

.. prizerun::

    tree -a .fancy_backups/objects

That's 3 file copies for the files from the first commit, 1 file copy from the
second commit, 2 directory listings (for first and second commit) and two
commit listings (for the first and second commit) = 8 hash objects.

Linking the commits
===================

Can we completely get rid of ``.fancy_backups/1``, ``.fancy_backups/2``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for our commit names "1", "2", "3" was so we know that commit "2"
comes after commit "1" and before commit "3". Now our commits have filenames
with arbitrary hashes, we can't tell the order from the name.

However, the commit hash does uniquely identify the commit.  For example, we
know that the file beginning '012ad9f' *completely defines the first commit*:

.. prizerun::

    cat .fancy_backups/objects/012ad9f6c3a715516514e8821a71d891c4211f8f

We can specify the order by adding the commit hash of the previous
(parent) commit into the current commit:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: .fancy_backups/2/info.txt
    Date: April 1 2012, 18.03
    Author: I. M. Awesome
    Notes: Fruit of enormous thought
    Tree: 1dca3837b1076cdcfb02e86018377725e5d0e86e
    Parent: 012ad9f6c3a715516514e8821a71d891c4211f8f

Now we have the order of the commits from the links between them, where the
links are given by the hash value in the ``Parent`` field.

And now you are already a git master.

Git rides in to save the day

**Note**: The rest of this presentation started off as Fernando Perez' git
tutorial in his `reproducible software repository
<https://github.com/fperez/reprosw>`__. I changed it quite a bit, so please
blame me rather than Fernando for any faults in the presentation.

We need to tell git about us before we start. This stuff will go into
the commit information.

.. prizerun::

    git config --global user.name "Matthew Brett"
    git config --global user.email "matthew.brett@gmail.com"

git often needs to call up a text editor. Choose the editor you like here::

    # gedit is a reasonable choice for Linux
    git config --global core.editor gedit

We also turn on the use of color, which is very helpful in making the
output of git easier to read:

.. prizerun::

    git config --global color.ui "auto"

Getting help
============

.. prizerun::

    git

Try ``git help add`` for an example.

Initializing the repository
===========================

We first set this ``nobel_prize`` directory be version controlled with
git.  We start with the original files for the paper:

.. prizerun::
    :hide:

    # Delete the current contents of 'nobel_prize'
    rm -rf .
    rm -rf .fancy_backups

.. desktoprun::

    unzip -o nobel_prize_files.zip
    cd nobel_prize

Create git repository:

.. prizerun::

    git init

What happened when we did ``git init``? Just what we were expecting; we have a
new *repository* directory called ``.git``

.. prizerun::

    ls .git

The ``objects`` directory looks familiar. What's in there?

.. prizerun::

    tree .git/objects

Nothing but a couple of empty directories. That makes sense.

git add - put stuff into the staging area
=========================================

.. prizerun::

    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt

.. prizerun::

    tree .git/objects

Doing ``git add nobel_prize_paper.txt`` has added a file to the
``.git/objects`` directory. That filename looks suspiciously like a
hash.

We expect that ``git add`` added the file to the *staging area*.  We will need
to use a command ``git status`` to check that, and that will come soon.

Looking at real git objects
===========================

Git objects are nearly as simple as the objects we were writing in
``.fancy_backups``.

The main difference is that, to save space, they are compressed, in fact
using a library called ``zlib``.

These objects are so simple that it's very easy to write small code snippets
to read them - see :doc:`reading_git_objects`.

Git will also show the contents of objects with the command ``git cat-file
-p``.

When we did ``git add nobel_prize_paper.txt``, we got a new file in
``.git/objects``, with filename ``d9/2d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553``.
The filename is in fact a hash, where the first two digits form the directory
name (``d9``) and the rest of the filename is the rest of the hash digits
[#git-object-dir]_.

Here's the contents of the object:

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p d92d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553

Just as we expected, it is the current contents of the
``nobel_prize_paper.txt``.

In fact we only need to give git enough hash digits for git to uniquely
identify the object.  7 digits is often enough, as in:

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p d92d079

git status - showing the status of files in the working tree
============================================================

The working tree is the ``nobel_prize`` directory.  It now contains a
repository |--| the ``.git`` directory.

``git status`` tells us about the relationship of the files in the working
tree to the repository and staging area.

We have done a ``git add`` on ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``, and that added the
file to the staging area.  We can see that with ``git status``:

.. prizerun::

    git status

Sure enough, the output tells that "new file: nobel_prize_paper.txt" is in the
"changes to be committed".  It also tells us that the other two files |--|
``stunning_figure.png`` and ``very_clever_analysis.py`` |--| are "untracked".

An untracked file is a file with a filename that has never been added to the
repo with ``git add``.  Until you ``git add`` an untracked file, git will
ignore these files and assume you don't want to keep track of them.

Staging the other files
=======================

We do want to keep track of the other files, so we stage them:

.. prizerun::

    git add stunning_figure.png
    git add very_clever_analysis.py
    git status

We have now staged all three of our files.  We have three objects in
``.git/objects``:

.. prizerun::

    tree .git/objects

git commit - making the snapshot
================================

.. prizecommit:: initial 2012-04-01 11:13:13

    git commit -m "First backup of my amazing idea"

In the line above, we used the ``-m`` flag to specify a message at the
command line. If we don't do that, git will open the editor we specified
in our configuration above and require that we enter a message. By
default, git refuses to record changes that don't have a message to go
along with them (though you can obviously 'cheat' by using an empty or
meaningless string: git only tries to facilitate best practices, it's
not your nanny).

We are now expecting to have two new ``.git/object`` files, for the directory
tree, and for the commit.

.. prizerun::

    tree .git/objects

Here's the contents of the tree object (directory listing):

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p e129806

These are in fact the file permissions, the type of the entry in the directory
(where "tree" means a sub-directory, and "blob" means a file), the file
hashes, and the file names.

Here is the contents of the commit object:

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p {{ initial }}

git log - what are the commits so far?
======================================

.. prizerun::

    git log

Notice that git log identies each commit with its hash.  As we saw above, the
hash for our commit was |initial|.

We can also ask to the see the parents of each commit in the log:

.. prizerun::

    git log --parents

Why are the output of ``git log`` and ``git log --parents`` the same in this
case?

git branch - which branch are we on?
====================================

Branches are bookmarks. They associate a name (like "master") with a commit
(such as |initial|).

The default branch for git is called ``master``. Git creates it
automatically when we do our first commit.

.. prizerun::

    git branch

Asking for more verbose detail shows us that the branch is pointing to a
particular commit (where the commit is given by a hash):

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

A branch is just a name that points to a commit.  In fact, git stores branches
as tiny text files, where the filename is the name of the branch, and the
contents is the hash of the commit that it points to:

.. prizerun::

    ls .git/refs/heads

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/master

We will soon see that, if we are working on a branch, and we do a commit, then
git will update the branch to point to the new commit.

git diff - what has changed?
============================

Let's do a little bit more work... Again, in practice you'll be editing
the files by hand, here we do it via shell commands for the sake of
automation (and therefore the reproducibility of this tutorial):

.. prizerun::

    echo "The charts are very impressive" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt

And now we can ask git what is different:

.. prizerun::

    git diff

You need to ``git add`` a file to put it into the staging area
==============================================================

Remember that git only commits stuff that has been added to the staging
area.

At the moment we have changes that have not been staged:

.. prizerun::

    git status

Git status tells us that git is keeping track of changes to
``nobel_prize_paper.txt``, and that the file has changed since the last
commit, and that we haven't yet put these changes into the staging area.

If we try and do a commit, git will tell us there is nothing to commit,
because nothing has been put into the staging area (staged):

.. prizerun::

    git commit

The cycle of git virtue: work, add, commit, work, add, commit...
================================================================

Now we have the main commands we need for working with git.  The typical cycle
is:

* do some changes in the working tree;
* ``git status`` and ``git diff`` to review what has changed;
* ``git add`` to add the changes to the staging area;
* ``git commit``

and repeat, and repeat.

For example, we have now done some work in the working tree.

We first check what changes there are that we might want to commit:

.. prizerun::

    git status

We might want to check what these changes are before we stage them:

.. prizerun::

    git diff

We add the changes for the one edited file to the staging area:

.. prizerun::

    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt

We might check again that git will add the changes to the next commit:

.. prizerun::

    git status

We do the commit:

.. prizecommit:: fruit 2012-04-01 12:01:01

    git commit -m "Fruit of enormous thought"

Adding with ``-a``
==================

So far we have done our commits with at least two steps: ``git add`` and
then ``git commit``.  It also possible to add files and commit the snapshot in
one step, using ``git commit -a``.

Here is an example.  We first add some text to a couple of files that we are
already tracking:

.. prizerun::

    echo "More self congratulation" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    echo "fudge_factor = 42" >> very_clever_analysis.py

Then we create another file that git knows nothing about:

.. prizerun::

    echo "My cat Arthur for dribbling on my keyboard" > acknowledgments.txt

.. prizerun::

    git status

Git tells us, as expected, that we have two modified files that have not been
staged, and one untracked file.   You also see that git has two suggestions
for us |--| that we do ``git add`` on the modified files (as we have done up
to now) |--| and / or ``git commit -a`` (the subject of this section).

Adding the ``-a`` flag to ``git commit`` means that git will:

* ``add`` any modified, tracked files to the staging area
* ``commit`` these modified files.

In our case, it is a shortcut for::

    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git add an_experiment.txt
    git commit

The ``-a`` flag to ``git commit`` ignores any untracked files |--| so
``acknowledgments.txt`` will still be untracked:

.. prizecommit:: a-flag 2012-04-01 12:13:01

    git commit -a -m "Paper nearly ready"

.. prizerun::

    git status

Maybe we aren't ready for the acknowledgments yet, so we'll delete that file
for now:

.. prizerun::

    rm acknowledgments.txt

If you have used other version control systems, the ``-a`` flag may look like
a good idea, but experienced users often find that they use ``git add`` and
``git commit`` much more often than they use ``git commit -a``.  The explicit
``git add`` helps us think about the changes we are adding, whereas the ``-a``
flag makes it easier to add changes we didn't intend.  So I recommend you
always use ``git add``, especially when you are learning, and that's how I'm
going to do the rest of the examples in this tutorial.

Git updates the current branch with the latest commit
=====================================================

Remember branches (bookmarks)?  Git has now moved the "master" branch location
up to the new commit:

.. prizerun::

    git log

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/master

Our most recent commit (|a-flag|) has the previous commit (|fruit|) as a
parent.  |fruit| has |initial| as a parent.  |initial| is the first commit,
and has no parent:

.. prizerun::

    git log --parents

A nicer log command using ``git config``
========================================

It is very often useful to see a summarized version of the log.  Here is a
useful set of command flags for git log:

.. prizerun::

    git log --oneline --topo-order --graph

Git supports *aliases:* new names given to command combinations. Let's
make this handy shortlog an alias, so we only have to type ``git slog``
to get this compact log.

.. prizerun::

    # We create our alias (this saves it in git's permanent configuration file):
    git config --global alias.slog "log --oneline --topo-order --graph"

    # And now we can use it
    git slog

git mv and rm: moving and removing files
========================================

While ``git add`` is used to add files to the list of files that git tracks,
we must also tell it if we want their names to change or for it to stop
tracking them. In familiar Unix fashion, the ``mv`` and ``rm`` git commands do
precisely this:

.. prizerun::

    git mv very_clever_analysis.py slightly_dodgy_analysis.py
    git status

Note that these changes must be committed too, to become permanent. In
git's world, until something has been committed, it isn't permanently
recorded anywhere.

.. prizecommit:: new-name 2012-04-01 13:15:01

    git commit -m "I like this new name better"

.. prizerun::

    git slog

And ``git rm`` works in a similar fashion.

git branch again - making a new branch
======================================

Remember that a branch is simply a bookmark pointing to a particular commit.

We can have multiple branches in a repository, where each one may point to a
different commit.

At the moment, we only have one branch, "master":

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

We can make a new branch with the ``git branch`` command:

.. prizerun::

    git branch experiment
    git branch -v

The new branch, by default, points to the commit we are currently on, and this
commit is the also the commit that the "master" branch points to.  So, at the
moment "master" and "experiment" point to the same commit.

Of course this new branch is also just a tiny text file with the name of the
branch and the commit that it currently points to:

.. prizerun::

    ls .git/refs/heads

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/experiment

git ``HEAD`` points to the current branch
=========================================

Remember that, when you make a new commit, git moves the branch pointer to
point at the new commit.  Now we have two branches, how does git know which is
the current branch, in order to move the right branch pointer when you make a
commit?

This information goes in a special git pointer, called ``HEAD``.  HEAD stores
the name of the current branch. HEAD is just a tiny text file storing the
current branch:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/HEAD

Here, HEAD is pointing to the "master" branch.  The master branch is pointing
to a particular commit:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/master

Developing on different branches
================================

Let's now illustrate all of this with a concrete example. We get our bearings
first:

.. prizerun::

    git status

.. prizerun::

    ls

We are now going to try two different routes of development: we will add one
file on on the ``experiment`` branch, and we will add another file on the
``master`` branch. We will then merge the ``experiment`` branch into
``master``.

How do we start working on this branch ``experiment`` rather than
``master``?

git checkout - set the current branch, set the working tree from a commit
=========================================================================

Up until now we have been on the ``master`` branch. When we make a
commit, the ``master`` branch pointer (``.git/refs/heads/master``) moves
up to point to our most recent commit.

``git checkout`` can switch us to using another branch:

.. prizerun::

    git checkout experiment

What just happened?

The current branch has changed (notice the asterisk in front of
``experiment``).

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

Git ``HEAD`` now points to the ``experiment`` branch:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/HEAD

As we'll see later, ``git checkout somebranch`` also sets the contents
of the working tree to match the commit contents for ``somebranch``. In
this case the commits for ``master`` and ``experiment`` are currently
the same, meaning they have the same corresponding working tree, so our
working tree did not change.

Now let's do some changes on the ``experiment`` branch:

.. prizecommit:: an-experiment 2012-04-01 13:13:13

    echo "Some crazy idea" > an_experiment.txt
    git add an_experiment.txt
    git commit -m "Trying something new"

.. prizerun::

    git slog

Notice we have a new file called ``an_experiment.txt`` in this branch:

.. prizerun::

    ls

The ``experiment`` branch pointer has now moved up to the current commit:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/experiment

But the ``master`` branch points to the same place as it did before:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v

git checkout again - get a new working tree
===========================================

If ``somewhere`` is a branch name, then ``git checkout somewhere``
selects ``somewhere`` as the current branch. It also resets the working
tree to match the working tree for that commit.

.. prizerun::

    git checkout master
    cat .git/HEAD

We're back to the working tree as of the ``master`` branch;
``an_experiment.txt`` has gone now.

.. prizerun::

    ls

Meanwhile we do some more work on master:

.. prizerun::

    git slog

.. prizecommit:: boring 2012-04-01 13:43:13

    echo "All the while, more work goes on in master..." >> boring_idea.txt
    git add boring_idea.txt
    git commit -m "The mainline keeps moving"
    git slog

git merge - merging changes from different branches
===================================================

We do a merge when we have made some changes in one branch, and we want to
bring (merge) these changes into another branch.

The typical situation is where we have made some useful changes in an
experimental branch - like our ``experiment`` branch, and we decide we want to
make these changes part of the main line of development - often the ``master``
branch.

Here is the merge:

.. prizecommit:: merge-experiment 2012-04-01 14:01:10

    git merge experiment -m "Merge in the experiment"

Notice now that the master branch has the new file ``an_experiment.txt`` from
the ``experiment`` branch, as well as the new file ``boring_idea.txt`` from
the master branch:

.. prizerun::

    ls

The git log output shows us two lines of development diverging and then
merging:

.. prizerun::

    git slog

The merge commit has two "parent" commits, which are the previous commit on
``master`` and the previous commit on ``experiment``:

.. prizerun::

    git slog --parents

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can't decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict. Let's see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.

We start by making another new branch and making a change to our experiment
file:

.. prizecommit:: trouble-starts 2012-04-01 14:23:13

    git branch trouble
    git checkout trouble
    echo "This is going to be a problem..." >> an_experiment.txt
    git add an_experiment.txt
    git commit -m "Changes in the trouble branch"

And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the *same*
file:

.. prizecommit:: while-trouble 2012-04-01 14:29:13

    git checkout master
    echo "More work on the master branch..." >> an_experiment.txt
    git add an_experiment.txt
    git commit -m "Mainline work"

So now let's see what happens if we try to merge the ``trouble`` branch
into ``master``:

.. prizerun::

    git merge trouble -m "Unlikely this one will work"

Let's see what git has put into our file:

.. prizerun::

    cat an_experiment.txt

Read these new markers as:

-  ``HEAD`` - the current branch - (between ``<<``... and ``==``) adds
   ``More work on the master branch...``;
-  the ``trouble`` branch (between ``==``... and ``>>``...) adds
   ``This is going to be a problem...``.

At this point, we go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision.

I'll do the edits by writing the file I want directly in this case:

.. prizewrite::

    # file: an_experiment.txt
    Some crazy idea
    More work on the master branch...
    This is going to be a problem...

I've now made the edits. I decided that both pieces of text were useful,
but integrated them with some changes:

.. prizerun::

    git status

Let's then make our new commit:

.. prizecommit:: merge-trouble 2012-04-01 14:33:13

    git add an_experiment.txt
    git commit -m "Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way"

.. prizerun::

    git slog

Git commits form a graph
========================

The output of ``git slog`` shows the sequence of commits as a graph.

The nodes of the graph are the commits. Each commit has one or more parents,
stored in the commit object.  The parents give the links between the commit
and the previous commit(s) in the *commit history* graph.  The commit parents
therefore give the edges in the graph.  If we start at a particular commit,
and then track back following only one parent for each commit, this is a
*path* in the *commit history*.

.. depends on history

For example, we might start at our current commit: |merge-trouble-7|.  This
commit has two parents: |while-trouble-7| and |trouble-starts-7|.  We might
follow one particular path to |while-trouble-7|, then |merge-experiment-7|,
then (from |boring-7| and |an-experiment-7|) to |boring-7|, |new-name-7|,
|a-flag-7|, |fruit-7| and finally |initial-7| (because |initial-7| has no
parents).  This is one *path* through the *commit history* graph.

git remotes - working with other people, making backups
=======================================================

Now you are keeping the history of your data, you also want to make sure you
have a backup in case your laptop dies.

You might want to work with a friend on the same project.  Perhaps your friend
Anne is also working on the paper, and you want to merge her changes into
yours.

We use git "remotes" to solve both of these problems.

Keeping backups with remotes
============================

First - a simple backup. Let's say you have an external backup disk and you
want to record all the history of your work on the backup disk.

To do this you need three steps:

* Make an empty backup repository on the external backup disk
* Point your current git repository at the backup repository with ``git remote
  add``
* Send the changes to the backup repository with ``git push``

Make the empty backup repository
--------------------------------

.. cmdaddvar:: usb_mountpoint
    :var_type: render

    echo "/Volumes/my_usb_disk"

.. cmdaddvar:: usb_mountpoint
    :var_type: run
    :omit_link:

    echo "\$PWD/my_repos"

Let's say your external disk is mounted at |usb_mountpoint|.

We make a new empty repository:

.. desktoprun::

    git init --bare {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git

Notice the ``--bare`` flag.  This tells git to make a repository that does not
have a working tree, but only the ``.git`` repository directory:

.. desktoprun::

    ls {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git

This is what we want in this case, because we will not ever want to edit the
files in the |usb_mountpoint| backup
repository, we will only be editing files in our local ``nobel_prize``
directory, committing those changes locally (as we have done above), and then
"pushing" these changes to the backup repository [#bare-detail]_.

Tell the current git repository about the backup repository
-----------------------------------------------------------

Check we're in our local git repository:

.. prizerun::

    pwd

Add a remote.  A remote is a link to another repository.

.. prizerun::

    git remote add usb_backup {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git

List the remotes:

.. prizerun::

    git remote -v

The list shows that we can both ``fetch`` and ``push`` to this repository, of
which more later.

The entire of the rest of the information about the remote is in the
repository config file |--| ``.git/config``:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/config

git push |--| push all data for a local branch to the remote
------------------------------------------------------------

We now want to synchronize the data in our ``nobel_prize`` repository with the
remote ``usb_backup``.  The command to do this is ``git push``.

Before we do the push, there are no objects in the ``.git/objects`` directory
of the ``usb_backup`` backup repository:

.. desktoprun::

    tree -a {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git/objects

Then we push:

.. prizerun::

    git push usb_backup master

This command tells git to take all the information necessary to reconstruct
the history of the ``master`` branch, and send it to the remote repository.
Sure enough, we now have files in ``.git/objects`` of the backup repository:

.. desktoprun::

    tree -a {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git/objects

You'll see that the 'master' branch in the backup repository now points to the
same commit as the master branch in the local repository:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/heads/master

.. desktoprun::

    cat {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git/refs/heads/master

The local repository has a copy of the last known position of the master
branch in the remote repository.

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/remotes/usb_backup/master

You can see the last known positions of the remote branches using the ``-r``
flag to ``git branch``:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -r  -v

To see both local and remote branches, use the ``-a`` flag:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -a  -v

git push |--| synchronizing repositories
----------------------------------------

``git push`` is an excellent way to do backups, because it only transfers the
information that the remote repository does not have.

Let's see that in action.

First we make a new commit in the local repository:

.. prizecommit:: buffing 2012-04-01 15:13:13

    echo "Express confidence in the study" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git commit -m "Buff up the paper some more"

Git updated the local ``master`` branch, but the remote does not know about
this update yet:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -a -v

We already know there will be three new objects in ``.git/objects`` after this
commit.  There are objects for:

* the modified ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``;
* the modified directory listing with the new hash for
  ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``;
* the new commit.

Usually we don't need to worry about which objects these are, but here we will
track these down to show how ``git push`` works.

The commit object we can see from the top of ``git log``. The ``-1`` flag to
``git log`` tells git to show just the most recent commit from the log:

.. prizerun::

    git log -1

So the commit is |buffing|. We can get the directory listing object from the
commit object:

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p {{ buffing }}

We can show the directory listing contents to get the object for the new
version of ``nobel_prize_paper.txt``.

.. depends on history

.. prizevar:: buffing-fname

    commit={{ buffing }}
    echo \${commit:0:2}/\${commit:2}

.. prizevar:: buffing-tree

    git log -1 --format="%T"

.. prizevar:: buffing-tree-fname

    tree={{ buffing-tree }}
    echo \${tree:0:2}/\${tree:2}

.. prizerun::

    git cat-file -p {{ buffing-tree }}

.. prizevar:: buffing-paper-obj

    git cat-file -p {{ buffing-tree }} | grep nobel_prize | awk '{print \$3}'

.. prizevar:: buffing-paper-obj-fname

    obj={{ buffing-paper-obj }}
    echo \${obj:0:2}/\${obj:2}

We do have these objects in the local repository:

.. prizerun::

    ls .git/objects/{{ buffing-fname }}
    ls .git/objects/{{ buffing-tree-fname }}
    ls .git/objects/{{ buffing-paper-obj-fname }}

|--| but we don't have these objects in the remote repository yet (we haven't
done a ``push``):

.. prizerun::

    REMOTE_OBJECTS={{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git/objects
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-fname }}
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-tree-fname }}
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-paper-obj-fname }}

Now we do a push:

.. prizerun::

    git push usb_backup master

The branches are synchronized again:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -a -v

We do have the new objects in the remote repository:

.. prizerun::

    REMOTE_OBJECTS={{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git/objects
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-fname }}
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-tree-fname }}
    ls \$REMOTE_OBJECTS/{{ buffing-paper-obj-fname }}

An algorithm for git push
-------------------------

Now we know about how git stores its objects, we can work out an algorithm for
doing a push.

#. Get the commit hash corresponding the branch we are going to push
#. Check if the remote has a matching object (filename). If yes, continue, if
   not then:

    a. Put the commit has into a list of *missing commits*
    b. Follow every possible *commit history path* back from this commit.
       For each commit on the path, if the commit is in the remote objects,
       stop, otherwise, add the commit to *missing commits* and continue to
       the next commit on the path.  Copy all *missing commit* objects to the
       remote objects directory.
    c. For every *missing commit* get the corresponding directory listing
       object (tree object).  If the tree object is not in the remote objects
       directory, add to *missing trees*. Copy all *missing trees* to the
       remote objects directory.
    d. For every *missing tree* read the tree directory listing. Find any
       file objects in the directory listing that are not in the remote
       objects directory, add to *missing file* objects.  Copy any *missing
       file* objects to the remote objects directory [#sub-trees]_.

#. Update the remote branch (remote ``refs/heads/master`` in our case) to
   point to the same commit as the local branch.
#. Update the local record of the last known position of the remote branch to
   point to the same commit.

This is what will happen in our case:

#. We look up the hash for ``master``, and we get |buffing| (abbreviated as
   |buffing-7|).
#. We look for the filename corresponding to |buffing-7| in the remote
   ``objects`` directory.  It isn't there.

    a. We put |buffing-7| into the list of missing commits;
    b. We follow all commit history paths back from |buffing-7| to check for
       more missing commits.  In our case we have only one path, because
       |buffing-7| has parent |merge-trouble-7|, the remote already has the
       object corresponding to |merge-trouble-7|, and we can stop looking for
       missing commits. We copy |buffing-fname| in local ``.git/objects`` to
       the remote objects directory;
    c. We only have one missing commit, |buffing-7|.  We look in the contents
       of |buffing-7| to find the directory listing (tree).  This is
       |buffing-tree|.  We check for this object in the remote objects
       directory, and sure enough, it is missing. We add this tree to the
       list of missing trees.  We copy |buffing-tree-fname| in local
       ``.git/objects`` to the remote objects directory;
    d. We only have one missing tree |--| |buffing-tree|. We look in the
       contents of this directory listing, and check in the remote object
       directory for each object in this listing. We are only missing
       |buffing-paper-obj|. We copy |buffing-paper-obj-fname| to the remote
       objects directory.

#. We set remote ``refs/heads/master`` to contain the hash |buffing|.
#. Set the local ``refs/remotes/usb_backup/master`` to contain |buffing|.

git clone |--| make a fresh new copy of the repo
------------------------------------------------

Imagine we have so far been working on our trusty work desktop.

We unplug the external hard drive, put it in our trusty bag, and take the
trusty bus back to our trusty house.

Now we want to start work on the paper.

We plug the hard drive into the laptop, it gets mounted again at
|usb_mountpoint|.

Now we want a repository with a working tree.

Maybe we make a directory for git repositories first:

.. runblock::
    :hide:

    mkdir my_repos

The command we want now is ``git clone``:

.. laptoprun::

    git clone {{ usb_mountpoint }}/nobel_prize.git

We have a full backup of the repository, including all the history:

.. laptoprun::

    cd nobel_prize
    git slog

git made a ``remote`` automatically for us, because it recorded where we
cloned from.  The default name for a git remote is ``origin``:

.. prizelaprun::

    git remote -v

Of course, just after the clone, the remote and the local copy are
synchronized:

.. prizelaprun::

    git branch -v -a

Now we could make some commits.

.. prizelapcommit:: wine-ideas 2012-04-01 20:13:31

    echo "The brain is a really big network." >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git commit -m "More great ideas after some wine"

The local copy is now ahead of the remote:

.. prizelaprun::

    git branch -v -a

At the end of the night's work, we push back to the remote on the USB disk:

.. prizelaprun::

    git push origin master

The local and remote are synchronized again:

.. prizelaprun::

    git branch -v -a

git fetch |--| get all data from a remote
-----------------------------------------

``git fetch`` fetches data from a remote repository into a local one.

Now we are back at the work desktop.  We don't have the great ideas from last
night in the local repository::

    cd nobel_prize

Here is the latest commit in the work desktop repository:

.. prizerun::

    git log -1

Here are the branch positions in the work desktop repository:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v -a

As you can see, the last known positions of the remote branches have not
changed from last night.  This reminds us that the last known positions only
get refreshed when we do an explicit git command to communicate with the
remote copy.  Git stores the "last known positions" in ``refs/remotes``.  For
example, if the remote name is ``usb_backup`` and the branch is ``master``,
then the last known position (commit hash) is the contents of the file
``refs/remotes/usb_backup/master``.

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/refs/remotes/usb_backup/master

The commands that update the last known positions are:

* ``git clone`` (a whole new copy, copying the remote branch positions with
  it);
* ``git push`` (updates the remote branches and therefore the local last known
  positions in the local repository);
* ``git fetch`` (this section) (reads the branch positions and data from the
  remote repository and copies the data and last known positions into the
  local repository);
* ``git pull`` (this is just a ``git fetch`` followed by a ``git merge``).

Now we have plugged in the USB drive, we can fetch the data and last known
positions from the remote:

.. prizerun::

    git fetch usb_backup

The last known positions are now the same as those on the remote repository:

.. prizerun::

    git branch -v -a

We can set our local master branch to be the same as the remote master branch
by doing a merge:

.. prizerun::

    git merge usb_backup/master

This does a merge between ``usb_backup/master`` and local ``master``.  In this
case, the "merge" is very straightforward, because there have been no new
changes in local ``master`` since the new edits we have in the remote.
Therefore the "merge" only involves setting local ``master`` to point to the
same commit as ``usb_backup/master``.  This is called a "fast-forward" merge,
because it just involves advancing the branch pointer, rather then fusing two
lines of development:

.. prizerun::

    git slog

git pull |--| git fetch followed by git merge
---------------------------------------------

``git pull`` is just a shortcut for ``git fetch`` followed by ``git merge``.

For example, instead of doing ``git fetch usb_backup`` and ``git merge
usb_backup/master`` above, we could have done ``git pull usb_backup master``.
If we do that now, of course there is nothing to do:

.. prizerun::

    git pull usb_backup master

When you first start using git, I strongly recommend you always use an
explicit ``git fetch`` followed by ``git merge`` instead of ``git pull``.  It
is very common to run into problems using ``git pull`` that are made more
confusing by the fusion of the "fetch" and "merge" step.  For example, it is
not uncommon that you have done more work on a local copy, before you do an
innocent ``git pull`` from a repository with new work on the same file.  You
may well get merge conflicts, which can be rather surprising and confusing,
even for experienced users.  If you do ``git fetch`` followed by ``git
merge``, the steps are clearer so the merge conflict is less confusing and it
is clearer what to do.

Linking local and remote branches
---------------------------------

It can get a bit boring typing all of::

    git push usb_backup master

It may well be that we nearly always want to ``git push`` the ``master``
branch to ``usb_backup master``.

We can set this up using the ``--set-upstream`` flag to ``git push``.

.. prizerun::

    git push usb_backup master --set-upstream

Git then records this association in the ``.git/config`` file of the
repository:

.. prizerun::

    cat .git/config

We do a commit:

.. prizecommit:: no-network 2012-04-02 11:13:13

    echo "Is the network comment too obvious?" >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git commit -m "Rethinking the drinking again"

Now instead of ``git push usb_backup master`` we can just do ``git push``.

Before we try this, we need to set a default configuration variable to avoid a
confusing warning. See ``git config --help`` for more detail:

.. prizerun::

    git config push.default simple

.. prizerun::

    git push

Git also knows what to do if we do ``git fetch`` from this branch.

To show this at work, we go home, fetch the desktop work, and then do another
commit from the laptop:

.. laptoprun::

    cd nobel_prize
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/master

.. prizelapcommit:: convinced 2012-04-02 22:13:31

    echo "More convinced by networks." >> nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
    git commit -m "I think better at home"

Then push back to the USB disk, setting the link between the laptop branch and
the remote for good measure:

.. prizelaprun::

    git push origin master --set-upstream

Back to the work desktop to demonstrate "fetch" after we have done ``git
push`` with ``--set-upstream`` above:

.. prizerun::

    git fetch

We still need to do an explicit merge:

.. prizerun::

    git merge usb_backup/master

Remotes in the interwebs
------------------------

So far we've only used remotes on the filesystem of the laptop and desktop.

Remotes can also refer to storage on |--| remote |--| machines, using
communication protocols such as the "git" protocol, ssh, http or https.

For example, here is the remote list for the repository containing this
tutorial:

.. runblock::

    git remote -v

Check out bitbucket_ and github_ for free hosting of your repositories.  Both
services offer free hosting of data that anyone can read (public
repositories).  Bitbucket offers free hosting of private repositories, and
Github will host some private repositories for education users.

Other useful commands
=====================

The commands complete the typical daily git toolkit of an experienced user:

*  `show <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-show.html>`__
*  `reflog <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reflog.html>`__
*  `rebase <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html>`__
*  `tag <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html>`__

See :doc:`rebase_without_tears` for a tutorial on ``rebase``.

Git: are you ready?
===================

If you followed this tutorial, you now have a good knowledge of how git works.
This will make it much easier to understand why git commands do what they do,
and what to do when things go wrong.

Introductions
=============

There are lots of good tutorials and introductions for Git, which you
can easily find yourself; this is just a short list of things I've found
useful. For a beginner, I would recommend the following 'core' reading
list, and below I mention a few extra resources:

1. `Understanding Git Conceptually
   <http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git>`__ gives another review of how
   the ideas behind git.

2. For more detail, see the start of the excellent `Pro
   Git <http://progit.org/book>`__ online book, or similarly the early
   parts of the `Git community book <http://book.git-scm.com>`__. Pro
   Git's chapters are very short and well illustrated; the community
   book tends to have more detail and has nice screencasts at the end of
   some sections.

This `visual git tutorial
<http://www.ralfebert.de/blog/tools/visual_git_tutorial_1>`__ gives a nice
visual idea of git at work.

For windows users, `an Illustrated Guide to Git on
Windows <http://nathanj.github.com/gitguide/tour.html>`__ is useful in
that it contains also some information about handling SSH (necessary to
interface with git hosted on remote servers when collaborating) as well
as screenshots of the Windows interface.

Cheat sheets
    Two different
    `cheat <http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/09/git-cheat-sheet.html>`__
    `sheets <http://jan-krueger.net/development/git-cheat-sheet-extended-edition>`__
    in PDF format that can be printed for frequent reference.

Beyond the basics
=================

As you've seen, this tutorial makes the bold assumption that you'll be
able to understand how git works by seeing how it is *built*. These two
documents, written in a similar spirit, are probably the most useful
descriptions of the Git architecture short of diving into the actual
implementation. They walk you through how you would go about building a
version control system with a little story. By the end you realize that
Git's model is almost an inevitable outcome of the proposed constraints:

-  The `Git
   parable <http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html>`__
   by Tom Preston-Werner.
-  `Git
   foundations <http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/foundation.html>`__
   by Matthew Brett.

`Git ready <http://www.gitready.com>`__
    A great website of posts on specific git-related topics, organized
    by difficulty.

`QGit <http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/>`__: an excellent Git GUI
    Git ships by default with gitk and git-gui, a pair of Tk graphical
    clients to browse a repo and to operate in it. I personally have
    found `qgit <http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/>`__ to be nicer
    and easier to use. It is available on modern linux distros, and
    since it is based on Qt, it should run on OSX and Windows.

`Git Magic <http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/index.html>`_ :
    Another book-size guide that has useful snippets.

The `learning center <http://learn.github.com>`__ at Github
    Guides on a number of topics, some specific to github hosting but
    much of it of general value.

A `port <http://cworth.org/hgbook-git/tour>`__ of the Hg book's beginning
    The `Mercurial book <http://hgbook.red-bean.com>`__ has a reputation
    for clarity, so Carl Worth decided to
    `port <http://cworth.org/hgbook-git/tour>`__ its introductory
    chapter to Git. It's a nicely written intro, which is possible in
    good measure because of how similar the underlying models of Hg and
    Git ultimately are.

`Intermediate tips <http://andyjeffries.co.uk/articles/25-tips-for-intermediate-git-users>`_: A set
    of tips that contains some very valuable nuggets, once you're past the basics.

For SVN users
=============

If you want a bit more background on why the model of version control
used by Git and Mercurial (known as distributed version control) is such
a good idea, I encourage you to read this very well written
`post <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/17.html>`__ by Joel
Spolsky on the topic. After that post, Joel created a very nice
Mercurial tutorial, whose `first page <http://hginit.com/00.html>`__
applies equally well to git and is a very good 're-education' for anyone
coming from an SVN (or similar) background.

In practice, I think you are better off following Joel's advice and
understanding git on its own merits instead of trying to bang SVN
concepts into git shapes. But for the occasional translation from SVN to
Git of a specific idiom, the `Git - SVN Crash
Course <http://git-scm.org/course/svn.html>`__ can be handy.

A few useful tips for common tasks
==================================

Better shell support
--------------------

Adding git branch info to your bash prompt and tab completion for git
commands and branches is extremely useful. I suggest you at least copy:

-  `git-completion.bash <https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash>`__

-  `git-prompt.sh <https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh>`__

You can then source both of these files in your ``~/.bashrc`` (Linux) or
``~/.bash_profile`` (OSX), and then set your prompt (I'll assume you
named them as the originals but starting with a ``.`` at the front of
the name):

::

    source \$HOME/.git-completion.bash
    source \$HOME/.git-prompt.sh
    PS1='[\u@\h \W\$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\\$ ' # adjust this to your prompt liking

See the comments in both of those files for lots of extra functionality
they offer.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#git-object-dir] When git stores a file in the ``.git/objects`` directory,
   it does a hash for the file, takes the first two digits of the hash to make
   a directory, and then stores a file with a filename from the remaining hash
   digits.  For example, when adding a file with hash
   ``d92d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553`` git will create
   ``.git/objects/d9`` directory if it doesn't exist, and stores the file
   contents as ``.git/objects/d9/2d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553``.  It
   does this so that the number of files in any one directory stay in a
   reasonable range.  If git had to store hash filenames for every file,
   directory listing and commit in one flat directory, it would soon have a
   very large number of files.
.. [#bare-detail] The reason we need a bare repository for our backup goes
   deeper than the fact we do not need a working tree.  We are soon going to
   do a ``push`` to this backup repository.  The ``push`` has the effect of
   resetting the position of a branch (usually ``master``) in the backup repo.
   Git is very reluctant to set a branch position in a repository with a
   working tree, because it the new branch position will not not match the
   current content of the working tree.  Git could either leave it like this,
   or checkout the new branch in the remote repo, but either thing would be
   very confusing for someone trying to use the working tree in that
   repository.  So, by default git will refuse to ``push`` a new branch
   position to a remote repository with a working tree, giving you a long
   explanation as to why it is refusing, and listing things you can do about
   it.  You can force git to go ahead and do the push, but it is much safer to
   use a bare repository.
.. [#sub-trees] You have probably worked out by now that git directory
   listings can have files (called "blobs") and subdirectories ("trees").
   When doing the copy, we actually have to recurse into any sub-directories
   to get needed file ("blob") and subdirectory ("tree") objects.  But, you
   get the idea.
