   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Pydagogue
====================

Pydagogue is a collection of tutorials that came to me while working on python
things like nipy_.

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    python
    git
    computing

You might also be interested on my `docosx`_ pages about developing on OSX.

.. the hidden toctree is to avoid warnings during the build.  The
   gh-pages-intro should probably be retired, `ghp-import` is easier.
